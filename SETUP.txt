### 1. Where do the Registrations (Information) go?
The information goes to **ishaaq.raja@gmail.com**.
- **Action**: 
  1. Go to [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) and sign up with your email.
  2. Create a "New Form" and copy the unique ID.
  3. Search for `YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE` in `index.html` and replace it with your ID.
- **Excel Output**: Yes! In your Formspree dashboard, there is a **"Download CSV"** button. This will give you an EXCEL sheet of everyone who registers.

### 2. Where does the Money go?
The money goes to **YOUR BANK / UPI account**.
- **Action A (Razorpay Portal)**:
  1. Open `index.html` at Line 297.
  2. Replace `pl_PLACEHOLDER_ID` with your Razorpay Button ID.
- **Action B (Deep Link UPI)**:
  1. Check `script.js` at Line 19.
  2. **DONE**: I have already set your UPI ID to `6006393231@upi`.

### Why am I seeing "Some error occurred"?
This error appears because the site is currently using a **placeholder ID**. It is safe. Once you replace it with your real ID in `index.html` (Line 297), the real button will appear and payments will work.
